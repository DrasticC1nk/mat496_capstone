## Title: Interactive Dark Fantasy RPG

## Overview

My project is about a game being handled and narated dynamically by my agent. It takes the user input and the current game state(that we store) and spits out the appropriate response and updates the saved states accordingly. It has NPC interactions, a fighting mechanic, invetory management, a veyr basic HUD and UI made entirely to be run in BASH/TERMINAL/CMD and load/save mechanics. 

## Reason for picking up this project

I love video games and I always wanted to play a game that has a dynamic narrative and I ca do whatever I want. Games like this probably do already exist and are a million times better than the one I made but I enjoyed devoloping this a lot especially the game mechnaics and how the agent and LLM together handle it all withoout hardcoding various logics. This could be used in games with existing mechanics to add dynamic diaogue options for the NPCs making interactions fell very natural and less monotonous.

## Plan

I wanted to add the following game mechanics to my project: 

1. NPC interactions
2. Inventory management
3. HUD/UI(As a programming challenge)
4. Save/Load Mechanic
5. Random Dice roll fighitng mechanic
6. Quests and rewards
7. Basic trading system

## Conclusion:

I managed to make something out of this. Most systems i wanted to impliment do work but still feel broken like in one instance where I kept taking money from an NPC by asking for it and it kept giving me. I managed to fix this with some constraints on trading where it will be prompted that this trade won't work but it feels incomplete. The story even though dynamic feels bland. I tried to create some lore and names for the places follwing the theme but it feels empty. The NPCs give weird dialogues and fighitng is boring. Despite being dynamic, the agent fail to do the task that you want to do. Overall it was a great and fun learning experince and when it does work it feels like magic. I would say a standalone game like this isn't feasible yet but when integrated with existing proper games, the dynamic dialogue and maybe quest generation can really help.
